As a flat-file CMS, Kirby eschews traditional databases like MySQL, opting instead to store all content directly in files and folders. This unique approach simplifies development, enhances performance, and offers unparalleled flexibility, making it a favorite among both developers and designers seeking a more agile and intuitive content management experience.</p><p>Kirby is built on PHP, making it familiar and accessible to a vast community of web developers. Its elegant architecture and powerful API allow for deep customization, while its user-friendly Panel provides a delightful experience for content creators. Whether you're building a simple portfolio or a complex editorial site, Kirby offers the tools to bring your vision to life with speed and efficiency.</p>"},"id":"47e6d531-df52-4725-b45d-3bcee232ac1c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"For Developers: Unmatched Flexibility and Control"},"id":"4ec44e7a-3376-47ed-b852-674fc0e95423","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Developers love Kirby for its 'no-database' philosophy and its commitment to giving them full control. Since content lives as plain text files (Markdown, YAML, JSON), it integrates seamlessly with version control systems like Git, simplifying deployments and team collaboration. There's no complex database to set up, migrate, or optimize, which drastically reduces development overhead and potential points of failure.</p><p>Kirby's templating engine is pure PHP, meaning you can use all the power of PHP directly in your templates without learning a new templating language. Its powerful API allows for custom routes, hooks, and extensions, enabling developers to build highly bespoke functionalities. The command-line interface (CLI) further streamlines tasks like user management, content creation, and cache clearing, making Kirby a truly developer-centric CMS.</p>"},"id":"658a8e8a-e786-46c4-8b2c-c2d1b1c7e256","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"For Designers: Intuitive Content Management and Creative Freedom"},"id":"39b27c05-b985-4e4c-81b9-3a58764902e5","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Designers often face the challenge of adapting their creative vision to the rigid structures of traditional CMS platforms. Kirby, however, empowers designers by separating content from presentation. The Kirby Panel, its intuitive content management interface, is clean, fast, and highly customizable. Designers can define content structures using simple YAML blueprints, creating tailored fields and layouts that perfectly match their designs.</p><p>The Panel automatically adapts to these blueprints, providing content editors with a straightforward and pleasant experience. Managing media is a breeze, with drag-and-drop uploads and built-in image manipulation capabilities. This focus on content-first design ensures that the creative output is never compromised by the CMS, allowing designers to focus on crafting beautiful and functional user experiences.</p>"},"id":"492300bf-7a43-41db-b9dd-16f09d002287","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Why Choose Kirby?"},"id":"a87ecd41-b0c3-438c-bcc7-d192eccc5731","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<ul><li><strong>Simplicity & Performance:</strong> No database means faster setup, fewer dependencies, and excellent performance.</li><li><strong>Developer-Friendly:</strong> Pure PHP, powerful API, and Git-friendly content.</li><li><strong>Designer-Centric:</strong> Flexible blueprints, intuitive Panel, and full control over content structure.</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> Fewer moving parts reduce the attack surface compared to database-driven systems.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Easily scales from small personal sites to large editorial projects.</li><li><strong>Future-Proof:</strong> Content is stored in human-readable files, ensuring longevity and easy migration.</li></ul>"},"id":"34085402-e78f-420c-9af2-0ea18e638ad1","isHidden":false,"type":"list"},{"content":{"text":"\"Kirby has transformed the way I build websites.
